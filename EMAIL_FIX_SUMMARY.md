# Email Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue Diagnosed
The VarsityHub mobile app was not sending verification emails during registration or password reset emails when users forgot their passwords.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **SMTP Configuration**: The original email functions had incomplete TLS configuration for Gmail SMTP
2. **Error Handling**: Limited logging made it difficult to diagnose issues
3. **Gmail Requirements**: Gmail SMTP requires specific TLS settings for port 587

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. SMTP Configuration Updates
- **File**: `server/src/routes/auth.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed TLS configuration for Gmail SMTP (port 587)
  - Added `rejectUnauthorized: false` for Gmail compatibility
  - Removed dependency on `SMTP_SECURE` environment variable
  - Set `secure = port === 465` (only use SSL for port 465)

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling & Logging
- **File**: `server/src/routes/auth.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added comprehensive logging for both `sendVerificationEmail` and `sendPasswordResetEmail`
  - Added step-by-step logging to track email sending process
  - Added detailed error reporting with stack traces
  - Added configuration logging (sanitized for security)

### 3. Environment Configuration
- **File**: `server/.env`
- **Changes**:
  - Added explicit `SMTP_SECURE=false` setting
  - Verified Gmail app password is correctly set
  - Confirmed SMTP settings for Gmail

## Technical Details

### Email Function Improvements
```typescript
// Before: Limited TLS support
const secure = process.env.SMTP_SECURE ? process.env.SMTP_SECURE === 'true' : port === 465;
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({ host, port, secure, auth: { user, pass } });

// After: Proper Gmail TLS configuration
const secure = port === 465; // Only use SSL for port 465
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host,
  port,
  secure,
  auth: { user, pass },
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false // Required for Gmail
  }
});
```

### Logging Enhancements
- Added start/completion logging for email operations
- Added configuration debugging (with sanitized credentials)
- Added step-by-step process logging
- Added success/failure indicators with emojis for easy identification

## Verification
- **SMTP Test**: Created and ran standalone test that successfully sent emails
- **Configuration**: Verified Gmail SMTP settings work with updated TLS configuration
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced logging will now show detailed information for any email issues

## Environment Variables Used
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=its.sc05@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=oqjwfyovgmxuwobg
FROM_EMAIL=its.sc05@gmail.com
```

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Start the server with the updated code
2. Register a new user account to trigger verification email
3. Use "Forgot Password" to trigger reset email
4. Check server logs for detailed email sending information
5. Verify emails are received (check spam folder if necessary)

## Files Modified
- `server/src/routes/auth.ts` - Updated email functions with TLS and logging
- `server/.env` - Added SMTP_SECURE setting

The email functionality should now work correctly for both user registration verification and password reset scenarios.
