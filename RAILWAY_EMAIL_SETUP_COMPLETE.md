## Email Functionality Improvements
1. **Fixed TLS Configuration**: Added proper `tls: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` for Gmail
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed step-by-step email sending logs
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error reporting and debugging
4. **Configuration Validation**: Added environment variable logging

## Testing Instructions
To test the email functionality:

1. **Register a new user account** in the mobile app
   - You should see detailed email logs in Railway logs
   - Verification email should be sent to the email address

2. **Test forgot password** feature
   - Request password reset from sign-in screen
   - Password reset email should be sent

3. **Check Railway logs** for email sending details:
   ```bash
   railway logs --tail 20
   ```

## Expected Log Output
When emails are sent, you should see logs like:
```
[email] Starting sendVerificationEmail for user@example.com
[email] SMTP Config - Host: smtp.gmail.com, Port: 587, User: its***, From: its.sc05@gmail.com
[email] Creating transport with secure=false...
[email] Sending verification email to user@example.com...
[email] âœ… Verification email sent successfully to user@example.com
```

## Next Steps
- The email system is now fully configured and deployed to Railway
- No localhost required - emails will be sent automatically from Railway
