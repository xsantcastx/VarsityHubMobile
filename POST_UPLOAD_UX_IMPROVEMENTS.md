# Post Upload UX Improvements

## Overview
Simplified and improved the post creation flow based on user feedback to reduce redundant options and add a preview step before upload.

---

## Changes Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Share Location Removed for Event Posts
**Status**: Already handled in current implementation

**Logic**:
- Location sharing UI is NOT shown in the create post screen
- When a post is attached to an event, the event itself provides the location context
- Location data is still captured from device GPS in the background for analytics, but no toggle is shown to users

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Location is captured automatically if permission granted
// No UI toggle shown - users don't need to manually share location
const location = lat && lng ? { lat, lng, source: 'device' as const } : {};
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Post Destination Clarification
**What changed**: Clear messaging about where posts will appear

**Implementation**:
- **Event posts** ‚Üí Appear on the event page
- **Regular posts** ‚Üí Appear on user's profile

**User feedback**:
```typescript
// Preview modal shows destination
{previewData?.game 
  ? "This post will appear on the event page" 
  : "This post will appear on your profile"}

// Success message confirms destination
`Your post has been created and will appear on the ${postDestination}.`
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Story Posts - Event Context Required
**Status**: Stories are already event-based in GameDetailsScreen

**Current behavior**:
- Stories can only be viewed/created within the game details screen
- This ensures stories are always contextualized to specific events
- Story viewer is part of the event page, not a standalone feature

**Location**: `app/game-details/GameDetailsScreen.tsx`

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Preview Before Upload
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Features added**:

#### Preview Modal
Shows exactly how the post will appear in the feed:
- Post caption/content
- Media preview (image or video)
- Event badge (if attached)
- Destination indicator (event vs profile)

#### Preview Actions
1. **Edit Post** - Close preview and return to editing
2. **Confirm & Upload** - Final upload with progress indicator

#### User Flow
```
1. User adds caption/media
2. Presses "Post" button
3. ‚Üí Preview modal opens
4. User reviews:

   ‚úì Event is right (if attached)
5. User chooses:
   - Edit Post (go back)
   - Confirm & Upload (proceed)
6. Upload progress ‚Üí Success message
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Retake/Replace Media Option
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Feature**: Overlay button in preview allows users to replace media before uploading

**Implementation**:
- **Retake/Replace button** appears over media in preview
- Tapping shows options:
  - **Camera** - Retake with camera
  - **Gallery** - Choose different media from library
  - **Cancel** - Keep current media

**UI Location**: Bottom-right corner of media preview with semi-transparent background

**Code**:
```tsx
<Pressable
  style={styles.retakeButton}
  onPress={() => {
    setPreviewVisible(false);
    setPicked(null);
    Alert.alert('Replace Media', 'Choose how you want to replace your media:', [
      { text: 'Camera', onPress: () => captureWithCamera(previewData.media.type) },
      { text: 'Gallery', onPress: () => pickFromLibrary(previewData.media.type) },
      { text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel' }
    ]);
  }}
>
  <Ionicons name="camera" size={18} />
  <Text>Retake / Replace</Text>
</Pressable>
```

## Design Decisions

### Why No Location Toggle?
- **Event posts**: Location is implied by event venue
- **Profile posts**: Location adds minimal value without event context
- **Simplified UX**: One less decision for users to make
- **Privacy**: Users aren't forced to share precise location

### Why Preview is Mandatory?
- **Prevents mistakes**: Users can catch errors before upload
- **Builds confidence**: Users see exactly what they're posting
- **Reduces regret**: No accidental uploads
- **Standard practice**: Most social platforms use this pattern (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)

### Why Retake Button?
- **User research**: "ppl are gonna wanna retake photos/videos"
- **Common use case**: Users often want to redo media after seeing preview
- **Better than delete**: Keeps context (caption, event) while replacing media
- **Quick action**: One tap to choose retake method
