🎯 Main Goal

Create a League Page (example: Stamford High School) that serves as a hub for all teams under that school or league — a place where visitors can see and access all the school’s sports teams in one place.

🏫 League Page Purpose

“The league page is perfect for schools, athletic conferences, or recreational leagues to showcase all their teams in one place.”

So the page represents the entire organization (the school or league) — not a single team.

🧩 What the League Page Should Include

The name of the league or school (e.g., Stamford High School).

A list of all teams, like:

SHS men’s soccer

SHS women’s soccer

SHS hockey

SHS basketball

SHS women’s basketball

Each team name should be a quick link that leads to that team’s individual page.

🚫 What NOT to Include

The Feed, Schedule, and Roster tabs or sections (as shown in the screenshots) — these are unnecessary for the league overview page.

Those are relevant only to individual team pages, not the overall league page.

📐 Design/Layout Notes

The quick team links should appear in cards (boxes) the same size as the contact info card in the example image.

Ignore the “Roster unavailable” part and the bottom tabs in the screenshot — those are for reference only.

The layout should be clean, focusing on navigation rather than detailed stats or rosters.

✅ Summary

League Page = Central hub
Team Pages = Detailed content (feeds, schedules, rosters)

So the League Page acts like a directory or homepage linking to the teams, not a detailed page with its own content.
