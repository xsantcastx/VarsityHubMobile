## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

### Quick Test Commands

```powershell
# Test health endpoint
curl https://api-production-8ac3.up.railway.app/health

# Test auth endpoint (should return error without credentials)
curl https://api-production-8ac3.up.railway.app/me

# Test from mobile app
# Update your app's API_BASE_URL and run the app
```
