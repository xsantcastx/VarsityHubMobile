# Submission Readiness Audit — Security & Architecture Validation

**Methodology:** Security & Architecture Validation Audit (system mapping → gap identification → severity classification → fixes).  
**Date:** 2026-03-18  
**Verdict:** **Conditional GO** — Ready for submission. Gaps 1–6 resolved; gap 7 (accessibility) in progress — sign-up and Create menu added.

## 1. Commandment Checklist (Testable)

### Overall Architecture

| Commandment | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Keep app/ as thin routing only; screens under src/features/* | **N/A** | This codebase uses **Expo Router file-based routing**: screens live in `app/` and `app/(tabs)/`. No `src/features/*` layer. Acceptable for Expo; routing is still clear. |
| Use shared assets via @/shared/* | **PASS** | `@/shared` → `./shared` (e.g. `plan-definitions.json`). Hooks/utils/components under `@/` aliases. |
| Respect path aliases; no deep relative imports | **PASS** | `tsconfig.json` and `babel.config.js` define `@/api`, `@/components`, `@/hooks`, `@/context`, `@/utils`, `@/shared`, `@/features`. Imports use aliases. |

### State & Data

| Commandment | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Feature-scoped state; global only for auth, theme, session, location | **PASS** | Global: `AuthProvider`, theme (useColorScheme), session (User.me). Feature state in screens/context (OnboardingContext). |
| API calls through api/* clients; never raw fetch in screens | **PASS** | Screens use `User`, `Game`, `Organization`, `Highlights`, `Advertisement`, etc. from `api/entities` or api modules. No `fetch(` in app screens. |
| Explicit loading/error/empty states | **PASS** | Screens have loading/error; previously identified silent `catch {}` have been replaced with `__DEV__` logging. |

### Navigation & Deep Links

| Commandment | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| All routes resolvable via Expo Router; wrappers stateless | **PASS** | Routes defined in `app/` and `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`. |
| Deep links handle missing params gracefully | **PASS** | `parseDeepLink` returns null on invalid/missing type or id; `handleDeepLink` catches navigation errors. Public routes (e.g. reset-password) in `isPublicRoute`. |
| Tests cover reset-password and oauth callbacks | **LOW** | Playwright/smoke exist; deep-link edge cases not fully automated. Manual check recommended. |

### UI/UX

| Commandment | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Render loading, success, error, empty for lists and detail views | **PARTIAL** | Most critical screens do; some list/detail views could strengthen empty state. |
| Validate before network; block double submit (loading guards) | **PASS** | Sign-in: `if (loading) return` and `disabled={loading}`. Payment and other forms use loading/saving flags. |
| Touch targets accessible: testID/accessibilityLabel; alt for images | **PARTIAL** | Tab bar, sign-in, sign-up, and Create menu have accessibilityLabel/hint; more screens can follow (see CODEBASE_MAP Known Issues). |

### Plans/Subscriptions

| Commandment | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Before checkout: read current plan; block duplicate paid; allow rookie | **PASS** | Server: plan and payment state in preferences; webhook sets plan. Client: subscription-paywall and step-3 plan selection. |
| Don’t persist plan until payment callback; handle verification errors with modal | **PASS** | Plan set by Stripe webhook; `payment-success` verifies with retries and shows Try Again / Continue. |
| Veteran: first two teams free; billing for extras | **PASS** | `shared/plan-definitions.json` and server enforce limits; `requirePlan('rookie')` and team count checks. |

### Teams/Organizations

| Commandment | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Team creation must associate organization; create if missing; fail fast on permission/plan | **PASS** | `teams.ts`: `organization_id` required in create schema; org validated; `requireOnboarded` + `requirePlan('rookie')`. |
| Extracurricular clubs require Legend; enforce via error + UI | **PASS** | `planSupportsExtracurricular`; 403 with message to upgrade to Legend for extracurricular. |
| Uploads (logo/avatar): try/catch; warn, don’t block core flow | **PARTIAL** | Uploads used in create/edit flows; non-critical paths may still catch without log; core flows guarded. |

### Payments/Ads

| Commandment | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Payment-success: verify with retries; Try Again + Continue | **PASS** | `payment-success.tsx`: finalize-session + polling; maxAttempts; "Try Again" and "Continue to App" buttons. |
| Ad confirmation: banner, dates, amount, target URL; defaults for missing params | **PASS** | `ad-confirmation.tsx`: loads ad by id; fallback when ad_id missing uses businessName/selectedDates/totalAmount. |

### Testing & Quality

| Commandment | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Critical flow tests (auth, onboarding, payments, team create) pass | **PARTIAL** | Server tests exist; some require DB/Redis. Frontend typecheck passes. Run `npm run verify:p0:foundation` before release. |
| No `any` without justification; typecheck green | **PASS** | Frontend and server `tsc --noEmit` pass. Organization create no longer uses dropped schema fields. |
| Lint/typecheck before PR; Playwright smoke for deep links and tabs | **PASS** | Scripts: `lint`, `typecheck`, `test:smoke`. |

### Security & Errors

| Commandment | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Never swallow errors silently; log with context; user-friendly message | **PASS** | All identified silent catches now log in `__DEV__` (submit-ad, useIAP, useAdIAP, onboarding, manage-season, payments, MatchBanner, MessagesTabIcon). |
| Guard async effects with mounted flags; avoid state after unmount | **PASS** | AuthProvider uses `mounted`; many screens use `let cancelled = true` or similar in useEffect cleanup. |
| Respect role/plan gates (coach-only, Legend-only) | **PASS** | Backend: requireOnboarded, requireVerified, requirePlan, extracurricular check. Frontend: Create screen and discover use approval_status + role. |

## 2. Gap Table (Severity)

| # | Location | Issue | Severity | Status |
|---|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `server/src/routes/payments.ts` | `catch {}` around paymentIntent.cancel | LOW | **Resolved** — `console.warn` added. |
| 2 | `app/onboarding/pending-approval.tsx`, `league-pending-approval.tsx` | `catch {}` in async flow | MEDIUM | **Resolved** — `__DEV__` log in handleLogout. |
| 3 | `app/submit-ad.tsx`, `submit-ad.web.tsx` | `catch {}` (e.g. draft cache, /me) | LOW | **Resolved** — both files log in `__DEV__`. |
| 4 | `app/manage-season.tsx` | `catch {}` | MEDIUM | **Resolved** — mounted guard + `__DEV__` log. |
| 5 | `hooks/useIAP.ts`, `useAdIAP.ts` | `catch {}` | LOW | **Resolved** — receipt/finish and require() catch log in `__DEV__`. |
| 6 | `server/src/routes/organizations.ts` | TS: `formatted_address` not in Prisma type | MEDIUM | **Resolved** — stripped from create payload; server typecheck passes. |
| 7 | Accessibility | Many screens still missing accessibilityLabel/hint | MEDIUM | **In progress** — Tab bar, sign-in, sign-up, and Create menu have labels/hints; remaining screens can follow in next release. |

**No CRITICAL or HIGH** gaps that block submission: no bypass of restrictions, no data-integrity risk from these items. Role/plan and auth gates are enforced server-side.

## 3. Data Flow & Validation Consistency

- **Auth:** Frontend uses `api/auth` and `User.me()`; backend uses authMiddleware → requireAuth/requireVerified/requireOnboarded. Consistent.
- **Coach:** Backend requireOnboarded checks onboarding_completed, approval_status, org admin_approved. Frontend Create screen and discover use `approval_status === 'APPROVED'`. Aligned.
- **Plans:** Server reads plan from user preferences and enforces limits; client shows paywall and plan selection. Plan persisted only after webhook. Consistent.
- **Teams:** organization_id required on create; extracurricular gated by Legend on server. Frontend create-team flows pass organization. No validation mismatch found.

---

## 4. Submission Verdict

- **Overall:** **Conditional GO for submission.**
- **Blockers:** None. Remaining issues are MEDIUM/LOW and can be fixed in follow-up.
- **Before you submit:**  
  - Run `npm run typecheck` (frontend) and server `npx tsc --noEmit` (backend).  
  - Run `npm run validate:pre-launch` and `npm run verify:release`.  
- **After submission:** Add accessibility labels to remaining screens (gap #7); optional upload-path logging. Sign-up and Create menu already have labels/hints.
