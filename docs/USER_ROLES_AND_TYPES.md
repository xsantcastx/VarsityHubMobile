## üè∑Ô∏è Demographic Labels (Non-Functional)

These are **descriptive labels** that do NOT affect functionality. Anyone can have these.

- Analytics/demographics (backend)
- Content personalization

**NOT Used For:**
- Access control
- Feature gating
- Payment logic
- Onboarding routing

**Example:**
```json
{
  "role": "coach",  // Functional role
  "plan": "veteran",
  "demographic": "youth",  // Informational label
  "preferences": {
    "age_group": "youth"  // Can be "youth", "boomer", "adult", etc.
  }
}
```

```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. DON'T Confuse "Rookie" with "Youth"
- ‚ùå "Rookie" = Young player
- ‚úÖ "Rookie" = Free coach subscription plan
- ‚úÖ "Youth" = Age demographic OR youth organization type

### 2. DON'T Link Fan Accounts to Plans
- ‚ùå Fan with "Rookie" plan
- ‚úÖ Fan with NO plan (null)
- Fans are free users, they never subscribe

### 3. DON'T Use Demographic Labels for Access Control
- ‚ùå `if (user.demographic === 'youth') { disableFeature(); }`
- ‚úÖ `if (user.role === 'fan') { hideMangementTools(); }`

### 4. DON'T Call Plans "Player Types"
- ‚ùå "Rookie player"
- ‚úÖ "Rookie plan coach"
- Plans are for coaches, not players

## üéØ Implementation Guidelines

### When Adding New Features

**1. Check User Role:**
```typescript
const isCoach = user?.preferences?.role === 'coach';
const isFan = user?.preferences?.role === 'fan';

// Use role for feature access
if (isCoach) {
  // Show team management
}

if (isFan) {
  // Show follow/engage features only
}
```

**2. Check Subscription Plan (Coaches Only):**
```typescript
const plan = user?.preferences?.plan || 'rookie';

if (plan === 'rookie' && teamCount >= 2) {
  // Prompt upgrade to Veteran/Legend
}

if (plan === 'legend') {
  // Show unlimited everything
}
```

**3. DON'T Use Demographic for Logic:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG
if (user.preferences.age_group === 'youth') {
  restrictFeature();  // Don't do this!
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT
// Just store it for analytics
console.log('User demographic:', user.preferences.age_group);
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Fan sees plan selection screen"
**Problem:** Fan onboarding showing Rookie/Veteran/Legend options
**Fix:** Check `step-1-role.tsx` - Fans should skip to step-7
```typescript
if (role === 'fan') {
  setProgress(6); // Jump to profile
  router.push('/onboarding/step-7-profile');
}
```

### "Coach can't create team"
**Problem:** Coach marked as "fan" in database
**Fix:** Verify `preferences.role` is "coach", not affiliation

### "Youth org treated as player type"
**Problem:** Confusing affiliation with demographic
**Fix:** Affiliation is organization type, not user age
