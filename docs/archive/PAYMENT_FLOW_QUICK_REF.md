# Payment Flow - Quick Reference

## ðŸ”¥ Issue: User Stuck After Payment
**Problem:** After completing payment in Stripe browser, user returned to ad-calendar screen and was stuck there with confusing alerts.

---

## âœ… Solution: Automatic Redirect

### What Changed
**Before:** Complex conditional logic with multiple alerts asking "Did you complete payment?"  
**After:** Simple automatic redirect to My Ads when browser closes

### Code
```typescript
// After browser closes, automatically redirect
const result = await WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync(String(data.url));
setSubmitting(false);
router.replace('/(tabs)/my-ads'); // âœ… Simple!
```

---

## ðŸ“± User Flow

```
1. User selects dates in calendar
2. Clicks "Pay Now"
3. Confirms in alert "Continue to Payment"
4. Stripe browser opens
5. User completes payment
6. Stripe shows success page (in browser)
7. User closes browser (or it auto-closes)
8. âœ… Automatically redirected to My Ads
9. User sees ad with updated status
```

**Total time:** < 1 second after browser close  
**User actions required:** 0 (automatic)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Works

1. **Server verifies payment** (via Stripe webhooks)
2. **Client just displays status** (not responsible for verification)
3. **My Ads shows current state** (Active/Paid or Draft/Unpaid)
4. **User can retry if needed** (if payment failed)
