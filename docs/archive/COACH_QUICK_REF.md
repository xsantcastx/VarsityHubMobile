## API Response Format

```typescript
// GET /teams/managed
[
  {
    id: "team-123",
    name: "Varsity Football",
    members: 25,
    sport: "Football",
    my_role: "coach",
    organization: {              // ← NEW!
      id: "org-456",
      name: "Lincoln High School",
      description: "...",
      sport: "Football"
    }
  }
]
```

## Testing Checklist

Test with coaches aged 50+:

- [ ] Can they find their league? (should be top card)
- [ ] Can they tap on a team? (full card is tappable)
- [ ] Can they add a game? (big green button)
- [ ] Can they read all text? (20-28px fonts)
- [ ] Do they feel confident? (simple = confident)

**Target**: 90%+ success rate

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test** the new UI in development
2. **Create** organization-profile.tsx page
3. **Wire up** "View League Page" button navigation
4. **Get feedback** from real coaches (50+ years old)
5. **Monitor** time-to-action and help requests

---

## Design Principles

1. **Big & Obvious**: All text 20px+, all buttons 60px+
2. **One Path**: No hidden menus, everything visible
3. **Simple Language**: "MY TEAMS" not "Team Management Dashboard"
4. **Icons + Text**: Never icon alone, always labeled
5. **High Contrast**: Easy to see in sunlight
6. **Generous Spacing**: 20px+ margins, hard to mis-tap

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

```bash
# Restore old version
cp app/manage-teams.tsx.backup app/manage-teams.tsx

# Or keep both
mv app/manage-teams.tsx app/manage-teams-simple.tsx
mv app/manage-teams.tsx.backup app/manage-teams.tsx
```

---

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative:
- Time to first action < 10 seconds
- Help requests down 50%
- Error reports down 70%
- App Store rating 4.5+

### Qualitative:
- "This is easy!"
- "I can see everything I need"
- "Finally makes sense"
- Zero "Where do I...?" questions

---

## Status

✅ Backend: Complete (organization data added)
✅ Frontend: Complete (simple UI ready)
✅ Documentation: Complete (guides created)
⏳ Testing: Pending (need user feedback)
⏳ Organization Page: TODO (next phase)

---

**Bottom Line**: If a 70-year-old coach can use it without help, we win. 🎯
