## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need ALL of these right now?**
A: The critical ones are: Email (SendGrid), Payments (Stripe), Maps (Google), Database, and Storage. App Store accounts can wait until we're ready to submit.

**Q: Can you set these up for me?**
A: We can guide you through setup, but accounts must be in your name/business for ownership and billing.

**Q: What if I'm not comfortable with the costs?**
A: We can start with the cheapest options (Railway, Cloudinary free tiers) and scale up as you grow.

**Q: How long do I have access to the credentials?**
A: These are YOUR accounts - you own them forever. We just need temporary access to set things up.

**Q: What happens if we lose an API key?**
A: We can regenerate most keys. The critical one to backup is the Android keystore file (we'll handle this).

**Q: Can we test before going live?**
A: Yes! We have staging/test environments. Production deployment only happens when you're ready.
