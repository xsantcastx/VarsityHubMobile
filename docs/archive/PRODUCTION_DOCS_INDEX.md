## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Credential Delays
**Problem**: Client takes too long to provide credentials  
**Solution**: Send clear requirements early, offer setup help, daily follow-ups

### Pitfall 2: Stripe Verification Delays
**Problem**: Stripe takes 1-2 days to verify business  
**Solution**: Start Stripe setup on Day 1, have client complete verification ASAP

### Pitfall 3: Apple App Store Rejection
**Problem**: Apple rejects app for guideline violations  
**Solution**: 
- Follow guidelines strictly
- Provide demo account
- Have clear app description
- Respond to feedback within 24 hours

### Pitfall 4: Environment Variable Mismatches
**Problem**: Different env vars between dev/staging/production  
**Solution**: Use `.env.example` template, checklist for all environments

### Pitfall 5: DNS Propagation Delays
**Problem**: Domain takes 24-48 hours to propagate  
**Solution**: Update DNS early, use low TTL, test with server IP first

### Pitfall 6: Missing API Key Restrictions
**Problem**: API keys exposed without restrictions  
**Solution**: Follow `SECURITY_CREDENTIALS_GUIDE.md`, restrict all keys

### Pitfall 7: Database Migration Issues
**Problem**: Production migration fails or breaks data  
**Solution**: Test migrations in staging first, have rollback plan

### Pitfall 8: Payment Webhook Failures
**Problem**: Stripe webhooks not reaching server  
**Solution**: Test webhook endpoint, verify firewall rules, check webhook secret
