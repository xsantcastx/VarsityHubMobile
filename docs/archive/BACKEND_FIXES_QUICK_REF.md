# Backend API Fixes - Quick Reference

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🔥 Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ → ✅ Ad Deletion Not Working

**Problem:** Delete button didn't actually delete ads from database  
**Cause:** No DELETE endpoint existed in backend  
**Fixed:**

- ✅ Added `DELETE /ads/:id` endpoint
- ✅ Added `Advertisement.delete()` to API
- ✅ Updated My Ads to call server API
- ✅ Cascade deletes all reservations

### 2. ❌ → ✅ Payment Shows "Unpaid" After Payment

**Problem:** Paid ads still showing "unpaid" status  
**Investigation:** Webhook code was already correct ✅  
**Root Cause:** User needed to refresh or wasn't seeing update  
**Fixed:** Automatic redirect to My Ads shows updated status

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### Backend - DELETE Endpoint

**File:** `server/src/routes/ads.ts`

```typescript
adsRouter.delete('/:id', async (req: AuthedRequest, res) => {
  // 1. Check ad exists
  // 2. Verify ownership
  // 3. Delete reservations (cascade)
  // 4. Delete ad
  // 5. Return success
});
```

### API Entity - Delete Method

**File:** `src/api/entities.ts`

```typescript
export const Advertisement = {
  // ... other methods ...
  delete: (id: string) => httpDelete('/ads/' + encodeURIComponent(id)),
};
```

### Frontend - Updated Remove Function

**File:** `app/my-ads2.tsx`

```typescript
const remove = async (id: string) => {
  // 1. Show confirmation alert
  // 2. Call API to delete from server
  // 3. Remove from local storage
  // 4. Reload list
  // 5. Show success/error
};
```
