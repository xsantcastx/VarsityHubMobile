# 📢 Ad Pricing Model Update

## Summary

Updated VarsityHub's advertisement pricing from a **per-day** model to a **per-week slot** model to align with Stripe configuration and clarify billing for advertisers.

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### Old Pricing (Per Day)
- **Monday–Thursday:** $10.00 per day
- **Friday–Sunday:** $17.50 per day
- **Model:** Each individual date selected was charged separately
- **Backend:** 1000 cents (weekday), 1750 cents (weekend)

### New Pricing (Per Week Slot)
- **Monday–Thursday Slot:** $8.00 per week
- **Friday–Sunday Slot:** $10.00 per week
- **Model:** Booking a date reserves the weekly slot at listed price
- **Backend:** 800 cents (weekday slot), 1000 cents (weekend slot)

## 💰 Pricing Breakdown

| Slot Type | Days Covered | Price | Stripe Product ID | Backend (cents) |
|-----------|--------------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Weekday** | Mon–Thu | $8/week | `prod_TJtJaRjlcRrFQM` | 800 |
| **Weekend** | Fri–Sun | $10/week | `prod_TJtKOftqpmv4Zp` | 1000 |

### How It Works
1. User selects dates on the calendar
2. Each date is categorized as weekday (Mon–Thu) or weekend (Fri–Sun)
3. Weekday dates cost $8/week, weekend dates cost $10/week
4. Total cost = sum of all selected slot prices

**Example:**
- Select **Wednesday** = $8 (Mon–Thu slot)
- Select **Friday** = $10 (Fri–Sun slot)
- Select **Wednesday + Friday** = $18 total

## 📝 Files Updated

### Backend (`server/src/routes/payments.ts`)
**Lines 14-33:** Updated `calculatePriceCents()` function

**Before:**
```typescript
const weekdayPrice = 1000; // $10.00 in cents

```

```

**Changes:**

---

### Frontend (`app/ad-calendar.tsx`)

#### Lines 15-16: Pricing Constants
**Before:**
```typescript
const weekdayRate = 10.00;  // Per single day (Mon-Thu)
const weekendRate = 17.50;  // Per single day (Fri-Sun)
```

**After:**
```typescript
const weekdayRate = 8.00;   // Per week (Mon-Thu slot)
const weekendRate = 10.00;  // Per week (Fri-Sun slot)
```

#### Lines 38-50: Price Calculation Function
**Before:**
```typescript
// Calculate price per individual day
// Mon=1, Tue=2, Wed=3, Thu=4 are weekdays ($10)
// Fri=5, Sat=6, Sun=0 are weekend ($17.50)
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Calculate price per weekly slot
// Mon=1, Tue=2, Wed=3, Thu=4 are weekdays ($8/week slot)
// Fri=5, Sat=6, Sun=0 are weekend ($10/week slot)
```

#### Lines 495-510: Calendar Legend
**Before:**
```tsx
<Text>Weekday (Mon-Thu) - $10.00/day</Text>
<Text>Weekend (Fri-Sun) - $17.50/day</Text>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Text>Weekday (Mon-Thu) - $8.00/week</Text>
<Text>Weekend (Fri-Sun) - $10.00/week</Text>

<Text>Weekday Rate (Mon-Thu): $10.00/day</Text>
<Text>Weekend Rate (Fri-Sun): $17.50/day</Text>
<Text>Each day is priced individually. Select multiple days to see your total.</Text>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Text>Weekday Slot (Mon-Thu): $8.00/week</Text>
<Text>Weekend Slot (Fri-Sun): $10.00/week</Text>
<Text>Each ad slot is priced per week. Select multiple dates to see your total.</Text>
```

#### Pricing Note Box
**Before:**
```
💡 Pricing Note: Each selected date is charged separately. 
Booking any day in a week requires full payment for that 
specific date - there are no partial-day discounts.
```

**After:**
```
💡 Pricing Note: Weekly slots apply to Mon–Thu (weekday) 
or Fri–Sun (weekend). Booking a date reserves your ad for 
that entire week's slot at the listed price.
```

## 🎯 Why This Change?

### 1. **Stripe Alignment**
- Stripe products were already configured for $8 and $10 per week
- Backend was using outdated fallback pricing ($10/$17.50 per day)
- This update ensures code matches live Stripe configuration

### 2. **Clearer Pricing Model**
- Weekly slots are simpler than per-day pricing
- Reduces confusion about "partial week" bookings
- Transparent pricing: Mon–Thu = $8, Fri–Sun = $10

### 3. **Consistent Billing**
- Backend and frontend now use same pricing
- UI displays match actual charges
- Transaction logs reflect correct amounts

### 4. **Better Value Perception**
- $8/week (weekday) is more attractive than $10/day
- $10/week (weekend) is much better than $17.50/day
- Lower prices encourage more ad bookings
