/**
 * Geofencing utilities for location-based event posting
 *
 * BUSINESS RULES (owner rules 2026-07-14 + Fanatics Fest punch list 2026-07-15):
 * - The geofence is strict for a user's FIRST upload to an event page: they
 *   must be within 3km of the venue with device-origin coordinates. That first
 *   pass writes an EventPostingUnlock row; for the next 7 days they may keep
 *   uploading (stories AND posts) to that same event page without re-passing
 *   the geofence.
 * - Regular Posts + Story Posts: the geofenced live window has NO early cutoff
 *   (owner rule 2026-08-28) — posting is open any time up to the live cutoff, so
 *   a fan who shows up early is never blocked. It closes
 *   `live_window_hours_after_start` hours after start (default 3; the Fanatics
 *   Fest day events set 18 so fans can post geofenced all day). Presence is
 *   enforced by the 3km geofence, not by a start-time gate.
 *   After the live window, a 7-day grace window remains open only for
 *   unlocked users (posting recaps from anywhere); then it closes for everyone.
 * - A manual designated-poster marker must be paired with an active
 *   EventPostingUnlock row, so one-off grants remain capped at the same 7 days.
 * - Sample events/games (IDs starting with "sample-") bypass all geofencing checks
 *
 * This maintains authenticity and prevents users from different states from trolling games.
