# 🚀 VarsityHub Beta Testing - Ready to Launch!

## ✅ What's Ready
- **Railway PostgreSQL Database**: Fully configured and populated with test data
- **Backend API**: Connected to Railway database, ready to serve requests
- **Frontend App**: Configured for both development and production
- **Test Accounts**: 3 beta test accounts ready for immediate use

## 📱 Test Accounts
| Email | Password | Role | Username |
|-------|----------|------|----------|
| coach@test.com | beta123 | Coach Smith | @coach_smith |
| player@test.com | beta123 | Alex Johnson | @alex_player |
| fan@test.com | beta123 | Sports Fan | @sports_fan |

## 🔧 Current Configuration

### Backend (Server)
- ✅ **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL 
- ✅ **URL**: `postgresql://postgres:AAsjKJWvsRouJdPbWNepiqyhyvYAYJbg@hopper.proxy.rlwy.net:22104/railway`
- ✅ **Sample Data**: 5 sports posts, comments, upvotes, follows
- ✅ **Environment**: Production-ready with Railway database

### Frontend (Mobile App)
- ✅ **Development**: Connects to local backend (localhost:4000)
- ✅ **Production**: Ready for Railway backend when deployed
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Configured for both modes

## 🎯 Start Beta Testing NOW

### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended for immediate testing)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend  
npx expo start
```

**Why this works perfectly:**
- Your backend connects to Railway database (production data)
- Frontend connects to local backend
- Beta testers get full functionality immediately
- No deployment delays or complexity

### Option 2: Full Production (Later)
- Deploy backend to Railway platform
- Update frontend to production mode
- Share production URL with testers

## 📋 Beta Testing Checklist
