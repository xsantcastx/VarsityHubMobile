# VarsityHub — Agent Usage Guide

## Codex Context Model

- In Codex, spawned agents start isolated unless the caller explicitly forks context or includes the needed background in the task prompt.
- `AGENTS.md` is instruction input for the session, not a Claude-style lazy-loaded memory system. Do not assume nested `CLAUDE.md`-style composition by directory.
- If a subagent needs prior audit state, scope boundaries, or decisions already made in the main thread, pass that context directly instead of assuming inheritance.
- Put repo-wide workflow rules here. Put task-specific role instructions in the spawned agent prompt.

## Instruction Ownership

- `AGENTS.md` is the authoritative repo instruction file for Codex and Codex-spawned agents.
- `CLAUDE.md` is maintained for Claude Code and Claude-managed worktrees. It is not the live instruction source for Codex.
- Shared product facts that affect both tools must stay aligned across both files: stack, payments, navigation, server-side invariants, and deploy rules.
- If `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` ever disagree, update both files rather than relying on one tool to infer intent from the other.

## Claude Worktree Hygiene

- `.claude/worktrees/` are local Claude worktrees and must never be pushed.
- Treat files under `.claude/` inside a linked worktree as Claude-local tooling unless they are intentionally tracked repo assets.
- Generated local artifacts such as `.snyk-cache/`, `metro.pid`, and Claude-local report output must not be treated as product changes.
- Before concluding a branch is dirty, distinguish tracked source changes from Claude-local worktree noise.

## System Architecture — one way to do each thing

Full verified reference: **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** (kept in sync with `CLAUDE.md`).
VarsityHub is a **modular monolith on PostgreSQL + Redis + Railway** (Cloudinary
media, Sentry observability) — NOT microservices/Kubernetes, by design. Do NOT
introduce K8s, Kafka, RabbitMQ, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, sharding, partitioning,
sidecars, or SFTP — they are correctly absent at this scale.

New code composes with these single patterns; never stack a parallel mechanism:

- **Outbound third-party calls → `runWithBreaker(name, fn)`** (`server/src/lib/circuitBreaker.ts`) for SendGrid / Cloudinary / Google Play / Apple. Stripe is the exception: SDK `timeout` + `maxNetworkRetries` (all 5 client constructions), not a breaker. No ad-hoc external-call retry loops.
- **Screen data → react-query via the single `lib/queryClient.ts`**; spinner on `isPending`, never `isFetching`. No second QueryClient / parallel fetch cache. `PostCacheContext` = cross-screen post sharing, not a fetch cache.
- **Public event discovery (2026-09-06)**: feed and map use `/event-discovery?paginated=true`, sharing a 14-day upcoming horizon plus live-event lookback via `shared/runtime/discoveryPolicy.js`. Candidate pages can be empty with a continuation; clients must follow `next_cursor`. Cursors are encrypted, viewer/filter-bound and expire after 15 minutes. Historical pages retain media-only visibility and authorized-upload exceptions; the following calendar keeps its separate one-year scope. Other means levels outside major/minor/college, including missing league metadata. Deploy the server contract before publishing the client.
- **Realtime → the single `server/src/realtime/socketServer.ts`** (JWT handshake, per-conversation room auth, Redis adapter, websocket-only). Polling stays as fallback.
- **Startup-once work → `runClusterOnce`** (`distributedLock.ts`); scheduler worker runs on all replicas. No new leader election.
- **Cross-replica state lives in Redis** (rate limit DB 1, BullMQ DB 0, cache DB 2, locks, socket adapter). No in-process shared state — it breaks under `numReplicas>1` (`railway.toml`).
- **RLS is enabled-not-forced** (dormant). NEVER `FORCE` without a non-owner DB role + `SET LOCAL app.current_user_id` middleware; `start.sh` auto-applies migrations to prod on every deploy.
- **Sport-program layer (2026-07, Phase 0+1, ships dark; re-keyed 2026-07-10)**: `SportProgram` groups a team's siblings by `(organization_id, sport)` — unique constraint, so an org has at most one program per sport, full stop. `Team.gender` (`boys`/`girls`/`coed`) and `Team.level` (`varsity`/`jv`/`freshman`/`middle_school`/`unified`/`other`) are both nullable team attributes — a program's boys' and girls' teams are sibling level teams inside the same program, not separate programs. `Team.program_id` is nullable and additive — existing teams are unaffected until backfilled. Canonical sports live in `shared/sports-taxonomy.json`, loaded server-side by `server/src/lib/sportsTaxonomy.ts` (`normalizeSportToSlug`) and client-side by `constants/sports.ts`, which feeds the create-team sport picker. `server/scripts/backfill-sport-programs.ts` is the one-time migration path — dry-run by default, reports unresolved teams, never guesses a program. Program endpoints: `POST /organizations/:id/programs` is gated to the org owner or an active org member; `GET /organizations/:id/programs` is any authenticated user (public read). Billing still counts teams, not programs — the per-sport billing re-unit is Phase 4 and not yet built, and now counts one unit per SPORT (not per sport-gender pair), which lowers the expected unit count for schools running both boys' and girls' teams in a sport.
- **Sport-program public page (2026-07, Phase 3)**: `app/program-page.tsx` is a thin redirect shim (Phase 2, owner July-28: ONE sport page = team-page) — it fetches the program summary and redirects to the level/gender-first sub-team's team-page (Boys Varsity first), carrying from=program; a program with no visible sub-teams shows a graceful empty state. It has NO rendering surface of its own. Historically it WAS the canonical public surface for a sport program — one page per sport (re-shaped 2026-07-12): a sub-team picker — one tappable button per sub-team (Boys Varsity, Girls JV, …), ordered by level then gender — where tapping a sub-team shows just THAT sub-team's upcoming events (owner model, July 28: the whole sport is ONE page, sub-teams live inside it, no separate per-sub-team public pages), plus a follow button and the standard four states. Controls render only when they disambiguate. A sport that resolves to exactly ONE (visible) team is not shown as a program at all — program-page redirects to that team's team-page (with from=program to stop the reverse redirect), and the org links every sport straight to team-page (Phase 2), so a one-team sport never renders both a program wrapper and a team page (owner no-duplicates rule, 2026-07-27). The display logic is the pure `buildProgramSubTeams` helper in `constants/programs.ts` (pinned by `__tests__/program-labels.test.ts` + `app/__tests__/program-page.smoke.test.tsx`). There is NO public link to level-team pages: `app/team-page.tsx` is the canonical sport page (owner July-28): when a team has a `program_id`, its Events tab renders the sub-team picker (`buildProgramSubTeams`) for the whole sport — tap a sub-team to see its games — and it no longer redirects to program-page (Phase 1; the org/program-page routing flip to make it the SOLE page is Phase 2). Staff/admin surfaces (manage-teams, create-team, admin-teams, team-invites) pass `from=program` to open a level team deliberately — a contract in `__tests__/navigation-history-contracts.test.ts` enforces this. Three new endpoints: `GET /programs/:id/screen-summary` (program + `levels[]`, each with its serialized team and that level's games, plus counts — `server/src/routes/programs.ts`), `POST /programs/:id/follow` and `DELETE /programs/:id/follow`, and `GET /programs/:id` (branded share-landing page, `server/src/routes/shareLanding.ts`, falls back to a generic landing for unknown ids). Screen-summary privacy-filters level teams via `isTeamHiddenFromViewer` — hidden teams drop out of both `levels` and the `counts`, and an all-hidden program still returns 200 with `levels: []`. **Follow is a `ProgramFollow` intent ledger (`@@id([user_id, program_id])`) layered on top of the existing `TeamFollow` fan-out — feed clauses (`feed.ts`, `posts.ts`) are unchanged and still read `TeamFollow` only.** `is_following`/`followers_count` are intent-based: a `ProgramFollow` row means the viewer follows the program, and `followers_count` is a `ProgramFollow` count — this fixes the old union-read bug where following one level team made the whole program read as followed. `POST /follow` writes the `ProgramFollow` ledger row and fans out a `TeamFollow` row for every current active level team, stamped `via_program_id` (createMany + skipDuplicates, idempotent). `DELETE /follow` is lossless: it removes the `ProgramFollow` row plus only the `TeamFollow` rows stamped with _this_ program's id, so a pre-existing direct follow of a level team (unstamped) survives the unfollow. A level team added to a program later is reconciled exactly, not left stale: `fanOutProgramFollowersToTeam` (`server/src/lib/programFollowFanout.ts`) stamps a `TeamFollow` for every existing `ProgramFollow` user, awaited but wrapped so it can never fail the create/PUT request on team create and team PUT; it caps at 5000 followers per call and logs+captures when truncated, with a reconcile-script backstop for the overflow case still a documented follow-up (not yet built). This fan-out runs regardless of the newly-added team's privacy — a coach adding a private team to a program deliberately reaches existing followers; surfacing that to the coach before they add the team is a deferred UX follow-up. No `TEAM_FOLLOWED` notification fan-out on program follow (would spam staff once per follower). Group chats stay per level team — there is no program-level group chat. Deep links: `/programs` is in `SHAREABLE_PATHS` and the iOS `IOS_PATHS` AASA list, `AppLinks.program()`, and `program`/`programs` both map to `/program-page` in `utils/deepLinks.ts`. The Android `/programs` intent filter added to `app.json` is **native config — it ships only via `eas build`, never via `eas update` OTA.**

## Available Agent Types

### Explore

**When to use:** Finding files by pattern, searching code for keywords, answering "how does X work" questions.
**Example tasks:**

- "Where are all the places we call `sendPushNotification`?"
- "How does the refresh token flow work end to end?"
- "Find all screens that use `useLocalSearchParams`"

### Plan

**When to use:** Before any non-trivial feature or refactor. Use this to design the approach before touching code.
**Example tasks:**

- "Plan how to add a game scheduling feature"
- "How should I restructure the onboarding flow to support a new role type?"
- "What's the safest way to migrate the ad booking logic?"

### general-purpose (default)

**When to use:** Multi-step tasks that involve reading, editing, and running commands together.
**Example tasks:**

- "Fix the coach approval flow end to end"
- "Debug why push notifications aren't arriving"
- "Audit the admin dashboard for security gaps"

### claude-code-guide

**When to use:** Questions about Claude Code itself — hooks, slash commands, MCP servers, plugins, settings.

## VarsityHub-Specific Agent Patterns

### Debugging a server issue

1. Start with Explore to find the relevant route (`server/src/routes/`)
2. Trace the full data flow: client call → middleware → handler → Prisma → response
3. Check Railway logs for the relevant log prefix (`[org-get]`, `[notif]`, etc.)
4. Test with a real API payload — don't rely on static analysis

### Adding a new screen

1. Use Plan agent first to decide: tab screen or sub-screen? root Stack or hiddenTab?
2. Register in `app/_layout.tsx` (root Stack) AND `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` (hiddenTab) if it's a sub-screen
3. Use `safeGoBack` for back navigation, never raw `router.back()`
4. Add `headerShown: false` and implement your own back button

### Touching the server (Express routes)

- Server is at `server/src/routes/`
- Middleware: `authMiddleware` (JWT + DB lookup), `requireAuth`, `requireVerified`, `requireOnboarded`
- Business rules are enforced server-side — don't bypass with client flags
- Railway auto-deploys from `main` — test locally first with `railway run npm run dev`

### Touching the email system

- Do not rely on hardcoded template-count summaries in docs; check `TEMPLATE_IDS`, `REQUIRED_TEMPLATE_KEYS`, and `RECOMMENDED_TEMPLATE_KEYS` in `server/src/lib/email.ts`
- All other templates degrade silently — always add a plain-text fallback
- Email functions are in `server/src/lib/email.ts`
- Email delivery uses `EmailService` → `SendGridProvider` with existing retries/breaker. The legacy BullMQ email queue has no consumer; do not enqueue email jobs into it (`server/src/jobs/queues.ts`).

### Touching release/readiness flow

- Canonical release path is `docs/release/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md`
- Use `npm run release:verify:local` for code, regression, approval, and local gates
- Use `npm run release:verify:build` for EAS/build-readiness gates
- Use `BASE_URL="https://your-api" npm run release:verify:runtime` after Railway/provider changes
- Final launch sign-off lives in `docs/release/LAUNCH_READINESS_GATE.md`

### Payment changes

- iOS: Apple IAP only — never add Stripe links on iOS paths
- Android subscriptions: Google Play Billing via `react-native-iap`, server-verified at `POST /payments/google/verify-purchase` — never route Android subscription checkout to Stripe (Play policy)
- Android ads: Stripe PaymentSheet (ads use Stripe on Android + web; only subscriptions use Play Billing)
- Web: Stripe PaymentSheet for both subscriptions and ads
- Server enforces plan limits inside `$transaction` — race-condition safe
- Ad booking horizon is 56 days max — enforced server-side
- Ad inventory uses the single `server/src/lib/adInventory.ts` adapter: `AdReservation` stores paid dates, `AdSlotHold` stores expiring purchase-scoped holds, and settlement/refund/cancellation match purchase references. Run Again must preserve existing paid delivery. The September 5 migration requires an explicit old-writer stop before the new adapter starts; rollback must retain compatibility with live holds.

### Push notification changes

- `sendPushNotification(userId, title, body, data)` in `server/src/lib/notifications.ts`
- Always `.catch(() => {})` — push failure must never block the main response
- Check `[notif]` log prefix in Railway for delivery confirmation

---

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do These)

- Don't use Expo Go — always `npx expo run:ios` / `npx expo run:android`
- Don't run `eas build` or `eas submit` — costs credits, let the user run those
- Don't add client-side workarounds that bypass server-enforced rules
- Don't push to `main` without testing — Railway auto-deploys immediately
- Don't change Railway env vars casually. Sensitive vars like `JWT_SECRET`, OAuth keys, and Apple signing keys have production blast radius; rotate/change them only when the task explicitly requires it and after understanding impact.
- **Don't run `git stash apply` directly** — use `npm run stash:apply`. A bare stash apply leaves conflict markers silently; the script scans and reports them immediately.
- **Don't `git add -A` when the working tree has unresolved conflicts** — always stage files explicitly by path after verifying each one.
- **Don't assume a code fix is live.** Pushing to `main` deploys the server only (Railway). Publish client fixes with `npm run update:production`, which guards the clean tree, validates the production client environment, runs `eas update --branch production` and uploads source maps. Static web export uses the same production environment launcher. If publication is not already authorized and completed, remind the user to run the guarded command.

## Post-mapper Consistency Rule

Three LIVE post mapper functions exist and MUST stay in sync:

- `mapHighlightToFeedPost` in `app/game-details/GameVerticalFeedScreen.tsx` — used for highlights API data (the parity reference)
- `toFeedPost` in `app/profile.tsx` — used for profile post data (the `/profile` + `/(tabs)/profile` route)
- `toFeedPost` in `app/team-page.tsx` — used for the team-page post viewer

When fixing a field mapping in one, always check and fix the other two. Caption/content/title fallback chains, `preview_url`, `has_upvoted`, `has_bookmarked`, `author` shape (`id`/`username`/`display_name`/`avatar_url` fallbacks) — if they diverge, bugs appear in one context but not the others. Enforced by `app/game-details/__tests__/post-mapper-consistency.test.ts` (full-chain parity across all three live mappers) and `app/game-details/__tests__/GameVerticalFeedScreen.caption.test.ts` (caption chain). NOTE: a fourth copy formerly lived in `app/features/navigation/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`; that screen was orphaned dead code and has been deleted.

## Git Workflow

```bash
# Apply a stash safely (scans for conflict markers after apply)
npm run stash:apply

# Check for unresolved conflict markers across all source files
npm run check:conflicts

# Format all source files with prettier
npm run format

# Pre-push checklist
npm run check:conflicts
npm run format:check
npx tsc --noEmit --project server/tsconfig.json
npm run verify:error-envelope
```

**NEVER bypass the commit guardrails.** Do not use `git commit --no-verify` / `-n` or disable the pre-commit / pre-push hooks. They run tsc-files, eslint, prettier, conflict-marker and secret scans on staged files — skipping them has shipped un-typechecked, unformatted, secret-leaking commits. If a hook blocks you, fix the cause. `main` has no server-side branch protection, so these local hooks are the only gate before Railway auto-deploys to prod.

**NEVER claim verification you did not run.** "TypeScript passes" requires running BOTH the client (`npx tsc --noEmit`) AND server (`npx tsc --noEmit --project server/tsconfig.json`) typechecks in a tree that HAS `node_modules`, with 0 errors — not "skipped," not assumed. A worktree created without `node_modules` cannot typecheck the client; install deps or verify elsewhere. Same for tests/lint/route-reachability: report what you actually ran, or don't claim it.

## Team Role-Barrier Model (2026-07-06)

`server/src/lib/teamAuthorization.ts` splits team/org authorization into two tiers: `canAdministerTeam()` (team owner/coach, or org owner — settings, invites, roster add/remove/role-change, ownership transfer) vs `canManageTeam()`/`canManageAnyTeam()` (also admits team manager/assistant_coach and org manager — event/game create + approve/deny ONLY). Organization management (`isOrgOwner()`) is owner-only — org managers have zero admin power. Athletes/parents/members have no admin functions. New mutation endpoints must pick the correct tier explicitly. Athlete self-service team join requests were removed 2026-07-09 (rosters are coach-invite/direct-add only; the `TeamJoinRequest` table remains in the DB but nothing writes to it). Also 2026-07-09: teams hold STAFF ONLY — the `player`/`parent`/`member` team roles are retired (assignable: manager/coach/assistant_coach/equipment/health_wellness); athletes connect by following. `TeamRole` enum keeps retired values (no migration); legacy athlete rows are archived via `server/scripts/archive-athlete-team-memberships.ts`; invite-accept 410s retired-role invites.

## Security Invariants (Do Not Break)

- **Backup preservation:** API startup must not run destructive backup schema convergence (`prisma db push --accept-data-loss`). Apply reviewed backup schema repairs separately and rehearse them on an isolated restore first. Atomic refresh requires PostgreSQL object parity (including enum order, indexes, functions, policies and RLS), copies migration history in the same data transaction, and refuses incomplete source migrations or unsupported sequences. A scheduled restore drill must pass migration startup without applying repairs. Scheduler failures must propagate to job monitoring.

- **Private data exports:** use only dedicated private `DATA_EXPORT_S3_*` storage, never the public media bucket. All ZIP sections must succeed. Request/worker transitions are atomic; cancellation is terminal; signed URLs cannot outlive archive expiry. Failed deletion retains its key for scheduled retry. The BullMQ scheduler owns cleanup; do not also start the legacy cron wrapper.

- **No client-controlled security-critical state** — payment status, approval state, role, and plan are always server-authoritative
- **Backend validation is law** — frontend validation is UX only
- **IDOR guard on self-action** — users must never approve/reject their own pending requests
- **Deep link params use allowlist** — `buildRouteParams()` in `utils/deepLinks.ts` enforces per-route key allowlists
- **Webhook lock failures return 503** (not 500) so Stripe retries
- **Apple IAP cert chain pins to `CN=Apple Root CA - G3`** exactly
- **Org invite creation is owner-only** — only the organization owner creates/revokes org invites; org managers have no invite power
- **Payment-success non-auth errors surface on final retry** — no silent swallowing

### Audit-derived invariants (2026-07-14 · land with stacked PRs #168 → #171; full versions with helper/test names in `CLAUDE.md`)

- **Game approval is derived, never hardcoded** — all game writes use `deriveGameApproval`; batch endpoints authorize per row, never `.some()` across ids
- **Shared two-team resources: creator side authorizes, both sides notified** — opponent staff never delete a shared game or overwrite the other team's score; team reassignment re-triggers opponent consent; coach edits are field-locked
- **Subscription webhooks must match the subscription id** — an old-sub event never downgrades a user on a newer/other-rail sub; Google Play expiry enforcement ships together with its reconciliation job
- **Post `type` is a server whitelist** — non-admin `admin_broadcast` is coerced to `post`
- **Block filters merge, never clobber** — a block relationship must never widen a scoped query to global; all content reads apply block filtering
- **Minor-protection gates fail closed** — adult↔minor DM needs an _accepted_ follow; null DOB = blocked (`isMinor`/`isVerifiedAdult`, never `getUserAge() !== null`)
- **Post media hosts are allowlisted** — off-platform `media_url`/`poster_url` rejected
- **Approval self-review IDOR guard covers games AND events**
- **Coach auto-expire keys on `CoachApplication.submitted_at`**, never account age
- **Plan caps count pending invites** (enforced at invite create and accept)
- **No ownerless resources** — sole team/org owner cannot self-delete; membership removal syncs group-chat access
- **Share landings mirror og.ts gates**; private profiles/programs never leak
- **Private teams excluded from every public surface** (`isTeamHiddenFromViewer` et al., bounded `take`)
- **Meta-rule:** almost every one of these was a sibling write path bypassing a single-path pipeline — when adding a parallel path, reuse the existing helper, never re-derive its checks

## Security & Architecture Audit Standard

> Canonical full version lives in `CLAUDE.md` (`## Security & Architecture Audit Standard`), including the per-rule `Verify:` clauses. This section mirrors it for Codex; keep the two aligned when either changes.

Every audit rule is one of four types — **[AUDIT]** what a reviewer checks, **[ENG]** how code must be structured, **[BIZ]** VarsityHub-specific logic, **[GATE]** objective pass/fail. Every rule must be testable (state how we know it passed). Run the threat-model phase first: auth bypass, privilege escalation, payment spoofing, IDOR, webhook replay, stale-cache abuse, and deep-link injection. Classify findings by **exploitability × blast radius × recoverability**, not bare severity. Every finding ships with proof (files, repro, expected vs actual, fix); every fix ships with verification (typecheck, test, before/after repro, release risk).

**Commandments:** Thin routes, logic one layer down · Backend validation is law, frontend is guidance · No client-controlled security-critical state · One source of truth per domain object · Every protected action checks auth/role/plan/ownership server-side · Every async flow is idempotent · No silent failures and no fallback that changes security posture · No duplicate logic across routes/features · Every screen handles loading/error/success/empty · Every deep link fails gracefully and safely · Every admin action is auditable · Coordinate cross-replica via Redis, never in-process · Every release change is testable and reversible.

**PR gate (must all pass):** client + server `tsc` 0 new errors · no unbounded `findMany` · no `req.user` without `requireAuth` · no `sgMail.send` outside providers · no hardcoded dark text colors · screens don't call `fetch` directly · `npm run audit:navigation` shows 0 REVIEW · validation parity frontend↔Zod (or `// intent:` note) · four UI states on async screens · no silent `catch {}` in auth/payment flows · no fallback that changes security posture · webhooks/jobs idempotent · admin actions emit `AdminActivityLog` · security fix has before/after repro · schema change has migration status + rollback note.
