## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NEXT STEP

### Database Migration Required
The schema changes are defined but **NOT YET APPLIED** to the database.

**Run this immediately:**
```bash
cd server
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_event_approvals
npx prisma generate
npm run dev  # Restart server
```

**What this does:**
1. Creates migration SQL from schema changes
2. Applies migration to database (adds columns, indexes, relations)
3. Regenerates Prisma client with new types
4. Fixes TypeScript compilation errors in backend

**Without this step:**
- Backend will throw errors accessing new Event fields
- Event creation will fail
- Approval routes won't work

---

## üîß What's Remaining

### 1. Navigation to Approvals Dashboard
**Where:** Needs to be added to navigation for coaches/admins

**Options:**
- Add to coach/admin settings menu
- Add badge to profile tab (pending count)
- Add to create menu for coaches
- Add dedicated tab for coaches (conditional)

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// Example: Add to create.tsx for coaches
{me?.preferences?.role === 'coach' && (
  <Pressable style={styles.item} onPress={() => router.push('/event-approvals')}>
    <Text style={styles.itemText}>Event Approvals</Text>
  </Pressable>
)}
```

### 2. League Page (Optional)
**File:** `app/league/[id].tsx`

**Purpose:** Central hub for league-specific content

**Features:**
- Three tabs: Teams, Events, Highlights
- Teams tab: All teams in this league
- Events tab: Approved events linked to this league
- Highlights: Posts tagged with this league
- Geolocation: Auto-show nearby leagues

**Complexity:** Medium (3-4 hours)

### 3. Notification System Integration
**What:** Notify creators when events are approved/rejected

**Current State:** TODO comments in approve/reject endpoints

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In approve endpoint (events.ts line ~240)
await createNotification({
  user_id: event.creator_id,
  type: 'event_approved',
  title: 'Event Approved!',
  message: `Your event "${event.title}" has been published.`,
  data: { event_id: event.id },
});

// In reject endpoint (events.ts line ~275)
await createNotification({
  user_id: event.creator_id,
  type: 'event_rejected',
  title: 'Event Needs Revision',
  message: `Your event "${event.title}" was rejected: ${reason}`,
  data: { event_id: event.id },
});
```

**Dependencies:** Check if notification system exists (`/notifications` routes)

**Complexity:** Low (1 hour if system exists)

### 4. Event Detail View
**File:** `app/event-detail.tsx` (might already exist)

**Enhancements Needed:**
- Show `approval_status` badge for creators
- Show rejection reason if rejected
- Edit button for rejected events
- "Resubmit for Approval" action

### 5. My Events Screen
**File:** New - `app/my-events.tsx`

**Purpose:** Let users see their submitted events with status

**Features:**
- List user's created events
- Filter by approval status (pending, approved, rejected)
- Status badges (üü° Pending, ‚úÖ Approved, ‚ùå Rejected)
- Tap to view/edit
- Delete draft events

**Complexity:** Low-Medium (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Create 2nd event ‚Üí Status should be "pending"
- [ ] Create 3rd event ‚Üí Status should be "pending"
- [ ] Try to create 4th event ‚Üí Should show limit error with upgrade prompt
- [ ] Verify all 3 pending events show in coach's approval queue
- [ ] After coach approves one ‚Üí Try creating 4th event ‚Üí Should succeed (only 2 pending now)

### As a Coach/Organizer
- [ ] Create event ‚Üí Should be auto-approved (status: 'approved')
- [ ] Event should appear in public feed immediately
- [ ] Access `/event-approvals` ‚Üí Should see all pending fan events
- [ ] Approve an event ‚Üí Event should disappear from pending list
- [ ] Check public feed ‚Üí Approved event should now appear
- [ ] Reject an event with reason ‚Üí Event should disappear from pending
- [ ] (Future) Creator should receive rejection notification

### As a Fan (After Event Rejected)
- [ ] (Future) Receive notification with rejection reason
- [ ] (Future) View rejected event in "My Events"
- [ ] (Future) Edit and resubmit rejected event

### Permission Checks
- [ ] Non-coaches accessing `/events/pending` ‚Üí Should get PERMISSION_DENIED error
- [ ] Non-coaches trying to approve/reject ‚Üí Should get PERMISSION_DENIED error

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Create event with past date ‚Üí Should show validation error
- [ ] Create event without title ‚Üí Should show validation error
- [ ] Create event without location ‚Üí Should show validation error
- [ ] Extremely long description ‚Üí Should handle gracefully (truncate in UI)

## üìä Database Indexes

**Performance optimization already included:**

```prisma
@@index([creator_id])      // Fast lookup: "my events"
@@index([approval_status])  // Fast lookup: pending queue
@@index([event_type])       // Fast lookup: filter by type
```

These indexes ensure:
- Creator's event list loads quickly
- Pending approval queue is fast (even with hundreds of events)
- Filtering by event type is efficient

## üé® UI Screenshots Reference

Refer to `todo.md` screenshots for:
- Three-tier Discover layout (Team Hub, Create Event, Approvals)
- Event creation form design
- League page mockups
