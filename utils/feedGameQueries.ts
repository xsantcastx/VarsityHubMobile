 * Feed game query planning.

 * The feed used to issue ONE ascending query starting 3 days in the past
 * (limit 30). Once the recent past holds more than a page of games (seeded
 * pro slates guarantee this), page one never reaches today — upcoming games
 * exist on the map but never in the feed. Splitting upcoming and past into
 * separate queries gives each section its own budget.
 *
 * Verified live 2026-07-13: production /games returns real upcoming games
 * (MLB/WNBA/FIFA/Fanatics Fest) via this split-query plan.

 * 4 days, not 3, so a four-day event series stays referenceable from its own
 * final day. At 3 days, Fanatics Fest Day 1 (Jul 16) dropped out of the feed on
 * Day 4 (Jul 19) — the one day a fan is most likely to look back over the whole
 * weekend. A multi-day festival is the longest series the product supports
 * today; if that ever grows, this needs to become per-series rather than a
 * global constant.

 * carry a `live_window_hours_after_start` override — the Fanatics Fest day
 * events run 18h — so a fest event stopped being fetched as upcoming two hours
 * in and disappeared from the feed while fans at the venue were still posting
 * to it (reported live, 2026-07-16).
